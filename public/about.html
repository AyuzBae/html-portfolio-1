<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hii. My name is Irewole Glory Aboyewa, I was born on the 14th of July, 2001; 
  I'm 23 years old(Yeah, I know I look smaller than my age, lol) I was born in a town named Okitipupa, 
  I am an Ilaje from Zion Ikorigho community(It's crazy that I've only been there just once).</p>

<p>I went through Primary and Secondary school in my Dad's school: 
  Progresive Group of schools, both in Okitipupa(Primary) and in Igbokoda(Secondary). 
  I'd say those were one of the stressful moments of my life but OAU has proven me wrong. 
  Btw, I'm a Part 3 Microbiology student in OAU(Yeah, Great IFE).</p>

<p>I own a brand btw, "iluxury".
  I started Web development classes on Udemy some weeks ago and well, what you can see here is how far I've come with the classes so i guess I'll keep you updated with how it goes.
  Thanks for taking time to read through my mini-autobiography.</p>
